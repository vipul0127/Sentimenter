# Sentimenter

Sentimenter is a web application for performing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. Users can analyze individual sentences or upload TSV files containing multiple reviews. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify sentiments as positive or negative, represented with happy ðŸ˜Š and sad ðŸ˜” faces respectively.

## Features

- **Sentence Sentiment Analysis**: Input a single sentence to receive its sentiment analysis result.
- **TSV File Upload**: Upload a TSV file containing reviews to receive sentiment predictions for all reviews.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly web interface with Bootstrap styling.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file containing routes and logic for processing inputs.
- `uploads/`: Directory where uploaded TSV files are stored temporarily.
- `cvtransform.pkl`: Pickled CountVectorizer object used for text feature extraction.
- `model.pkl`: Pickled machine learning model used for sentiment classification.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering the web pages.

## Usage

- **Analyze a Sentence**: Enter a sentence in the provided text input and click "Analyze" to see the sentiment.
